                        <p>We use several third-party services that may also set cookies on your device when you visit our website. These include social media platforms (like Facebook and Twitter), advertising networks (like Google Ads), and analytics services (like Google Analytics). We do not control how these third parties use cookies.</p>
                        <p>Third-party cookies are used for analytics, performance monitoring, advertising, and social media integration. For example, we use Facebook Pixel to understand the effectiveness of our Facebook ads. These third parties have their own privacy policies and cookie policies, which we recommend you review.</p>

                        <p>Cookies have varying lifespans. Session cookies are temporary and expire when you close your browser or after a short period of inactivity. Persistent cookies remain on your device until they expire or you delete them. The lifespan of a cookie depends on its purpose and how it's configured.</p>
                        <p>Our strictly necessary cookies are typically session cookies that expire when you close your browser. Performance and functionality cookies may persist for longer periods, typically between 30 days and 2 years. Advertising cookies may remain for longer periods to track effectiveness of campaigns over time.</p>

                        <p>We use Google Analytics to understand how our website is being used in order to improve the user experience. Google Analytics cookies collect information about how visitors use our site, including the number of visitors, the websites that referred them, and the pages they visit on our site.</p>

                        <p>When you add products to your shopping cart, we use cookies to remember your selections during your browsing session. These cookies are essential for the shopping functionality of our website. Without them, you would not be able to add items to your cart or proceed through checkout.</p>
                        <p>The shopping cart cookies typically store a session ID that links to your cart contents on our server. They do not store personal information but allow us to maintain your cart contents as you navigate between pages. These are session cookies that expire when you close your browser.</p>

                        <p>If you create an account with us or log in to an existing account, we use cookies to keep you logged in during your browsing session. These cookies contain encrypted information that allows our system to recognize you as a logged-in user without requiring you to re-enter your credentials on every page.</p>
                        <p>Authentication cookies are essential for accessing account-specific features like order history, saved preferences, and personalized recommendations. If you select "Remember Me" during login, these cookies will persist beyond your current session. Otherwise, they expire when you close your browser.</p>

                        <p>Preference cookies allow our website to remember information that changes the way the site behaves or looks, such as your preferred language or the region you are in. For example, if you select English as your preferred language, a cookie will remember this preference for subsequent visits.</p>
                        <p>We also use preference cookies to remember accessibility settings you may have chosen, such as text size or color contrast options.

                        <p>For users in the European Union, we comply with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) requirements regarding cookies. We obtain explicit consent before setting non-essential cookies, provide clear information about cookie usage, and offer easy-to-use controls for managing cookie preferences.</p>
                        <p>Under GDPR, you have the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data, as well as the right to restrict or object to processing.

                        <p>For California residents, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides specific rights regarding personal information collected through cookies. You have the right to know what personal information is collected, the right to delete personal information, and the right to opt-out of the sale of personal information.</p>
                        <p>While we do not sell personal information in the traditional sense, some cookie-based advertising may be considered a "sale" under CCPA. You can opt-out of these practices using our cookie consent tool or the "Do Not Sell My Personal Information" link in our website footer. We do not discriminate against users who exercise their CCPA rights.</p>

When we transfer personal data outside the European Economic Area (EEA) or other jurisdictions with data transfer restrictions, we implement appropriate safeguards as required by applicable laws.</p>
                        <p>For transfers to third countries, we rely on adequacy decisions, Standard Contractual Clauses, or other valid transfer mechanisms. Our third-party providers may participate in privacy frameworks like the EU-US Privacy Shield (where applicable) or implement other measures to ensure an adequate level of data protection.</p>

                        <p>First-party cookies are set by the website you're visiting directly. These are generally safer as they can only be read by that specific website. We use first-party cookies for essential functions like maintaining your shopping cart and keeping you logged in during your session.</p>
                        <p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than the one you're visiting. These are typically used for advertising, analytics, and social media integration. While we carefully select our third-party providers, we cannot control how they use cookies once they're set on your device. You can block third-party cookies in your browser settings.</p>

                        <h3>20. Secure Cookies</h3>
                        <p>We use secure cookies for sensitive operations like authentication and checkout processes. Secure cookies are transmitted only over encrypted HTTPS connections, reducing the risk of interception by unauthorized parties. These cookies often have additional security attributes like HttpOnly and SameSite restrictions.</p>
                        <p>HttpOnly cookies cannot be accessed by client-side scripts, which helps protect against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks. SameSite cookies restrict how cookies are sent with cross-site requests, helping prevent cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks. Our security cookies also have short lifespans to minimize risk if compromised.</p>

                        <h3>21. Supercookies and Similar Technologies</h3>
                        <p>We do not use "supercookies" or other tracking technologies that are difficult to detect or remove. Our website only uses standard HTTP cookies that can be easily managed through browser settings. We believe in transparent tracking practices and provide clear information about all tracking technologies we employ.</p>
                        <p>We also avoid using flash cookies (Local Shared Objects), HTML5 local storage for tracking purposes, or other sneaky tracking methods. Any local storage we do use (for legitimate functionality purposes like caching) is clearly documented and can be cleared through standard browser controls alongside cookies.</p>

                        <p>Each cookie we set has an appropriate expiration period based on its purpose. Session cookies expire when you close your browser. Persistent cookies have expiration dates ranging from 24 hours to 2 years, depending on their function. We regularly review cookie lifespans to balance functionality with privacy considerations.</p>
                        <p>Authentication cookies for "Remember Me" functionality expire after 30 days of inactivity. Analytics cookies typically expire between 30 days and 2 years. Preference cookies may persist for up to 1 year. Advertising cookies often have shorter lifespans (30-90 days) unless used for conversion tracking of longer sales cycles.</p>

                        <p>We provide a cookie consent tool that allows you to customize your cookie preferences. When you first visit our site, you'll see a banner explaining our cookie use with options to accept all, reject non-essential, or customize settings. Your preferences are stored in a cookie so we can remember your choices for future visits.</p>
                        <p>The cookie consent tool categorizes cookies as Essential, Performance, Functional, and Targeting. You can toggle each category on or off according to your preferences.

                        <p>Some browsers offer a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that sends a signal to websites requesting not to track the user. Currently, there is no industry standard for how to respond to DNT signals. Like many websites, our site does not currently respond to DNT signals as we await clearer regulatory guidance.</p>
                        <p>However, we provide equivalent functionality through our cookie consent tool, which allows you to opt-out of tracking cookies. We continue to monitor developments around DNT technology and will update our practices if standards emerge. In the meantime, our cookie controls provide comprehensive privacy options.</p>

These opt-outs are device- and browser-specific.</p>
                        <p>For mobile devices, you may need to adjust your device settings to limit ad tracking. On iOS, go to Settings > Privacy > Advertising > Limit Ad Tracking. On Android, go to Google Settings > Ads > Opt out of interest-based ads. These opt-outs don't block all ads, just those targeted to your interests.</p>

                        <p>While we don't use Flash cookies (Local Shared Objects) for tracking, some third-party services that integrate with our site might. To manage Flash cookies, you must visit the Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager, which allows you to control storage of Flash cookies on your computer.</p>
                        <p>The Settings Manager lets you delete existing Flash cookies, prevent new ones from being created, and set storage limits. Since Flash cookies can store more data than regular cookies and aren't controlled through standard browser settings, it's important to manage them separately if you're concerned about tracking.</p>

                        <h3>32. Cookie Storage</h3>
                        <p>Cookies are stored in your web browser's cookie storage, which is separate from other browser storage mechanisms like localStorage or IndexedDB. Each browser manages cookies independently, so preferences set in one browser won't affect others. Cookies are domain-specific and can only be read by the domain that set them.</p>
                        <p>Browser cookie storage limits vary but are typically around 4KB per cookie, with 50-150 cookies allowed per domain. We design our cookies to stay well within these limits. Most browsers allow you to view, manage, and delete cookies through their settings or developer tools.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="policy-point">
                        <h3>33. Cookie Security</h3>
                        <p>We implement several security measures for our cookies: using the Secure attribute for HTTPS-only transmission, HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access, SameSite attributes to prevent CSRF attacks, and short expiration times for sensitive cookies. We also limit the amount of personal data stored directly in cookies.</p>
                        <p>For authentication cookies, we use cryptographic signing to prevent tampering and store only session identifiers rather than actual credentials. Our cookies are regularly reviewed for security best practices, and we promptly address any identified vulnerabilities in our cookie implementation.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="policy-point">
                        <h3>34. Cookie Performance Impact</h3>
                        <p>Cookies have minimal impact on website performance. Each cookie adds a small amount of data to HTTP requests (typically less than 1KB total for all cookies). Modern browsers are optimized to handle cookies efficiently, and we keep our cookie usage lean to ensure fast page loads.</p>
                        <p>Some third-party cookies may have a greater performance impact if they trigger additional network requests. Our cookie consent tool allows you to block these if performance is a concern. We regularly audit third-party scripts to ensure they don't negatively affect user experience.</p>

                        <h3>35. Cross-Device Tracking</h3>
                        <p>We may use cookies and other technologies to recognize you across different devices when you log into your account. This helps provide a consistent experience whether you're using a computer, tablet, or smartphone. We don't attempt to track non-logged-in users across devices.</p>
                        <p>Cross-device tracking is limited to authenticated users and is used only to improve service quality (like syncing your shopping cart across devices). You can prevent cross-device tracking by logging out of your account on shared devices and not using the "Remember Me" feature.</p>

                        <h3>36. Email Tracking</h3>
                        <p>Our marketing emails may contain web beacons or tracking pixels to determine whether emails are opened and which links are clicked. This helps us improve the relevance of our communications. You can opt-out of email tracking by disabling images in your email client or unsubscribing from our emails.</p>
                        <p>Email tracking is separate from website cookie tracking, though the data may be combined if you click through to our website. The information collected includes whether and when you opened the email, your IP address, browser or email client type, and which links you clicked.</p>

                        <p>Our website includes social media features like Facebook "Like" buttons and Twitter "Tweet" buttons. These features may set cookies to enable functionality and track your interaction with the widget. The social media providers are responsible for these cookies - we don't control how they use the data.</p>
                        <p>Social media cookies are only set if you interact with the widgets. Simply visiting a page with these elements won't set cookies unless you click them. You can prevent social media cookies by not interacting with these widgets or using browser extensions that block social media trackers.</p>

                        <p>Pages on our site may include embedded content (e.g., videos from YouTube, maps from Google Maps). Embedded content behaves as if you visited the other website, and these sites may set their own cookies. We don't control these cookies and recommend reviewing the third party's cookie policy.</p>
                        <p>To minimize tracking from embedded content, we use privacy-enhanced modes where available (like YouTube's nocookie domain). Some embedded elements won't function properly without cookies, so you may need to choose between functionality and privacy when interacting with these features.</p>

                        <p>Some links on our site may be affiliate links that earn us a commission if you make a purchase. These links may set cookies to track referrals. We clearly identify affiliate relationships where required, and you can avoid these cookies by not clicking affiliate links or clearing cookies after clicking.</p>
                        <p>Affiliate cookies typically track that you came from our site and may credit us for any resulting purchases. They don't provide the affiliate with your personal information unless you choose to share it during the purchase process. Each affiliate program has its own cookie policies we don't control.</p>
