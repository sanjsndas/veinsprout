                        <p>For school and institutional purchases, we may share order and usage information with the educational institution for administrative and reporting purposes. This may include confirming orders, providing usage reports, or coordinating professional development opportunities.</p>
                        <p>When products are purchased for classroom use, we may share limited information with teachers or administrators to facilitate implementation and support.

                        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect your personal information from accidental loss, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. These include encryption, access controls, secure servers, and regular security audits.</p>
                        <p>All transactions are processed through a gateway provider and are not stored or processed on our servers. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal information.

                        <p>We retain personal information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes for which it was collected, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements. When determining the appropriate retention period, we consider the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data, potential risk of harm from unauthorized use or disclosure, and applicable legal requirements.</p>
                        <p>Account information is generally retained while your account remains active and for a reasonable period afterward in case you decide to reactivate your account. Transaction records are typically maintained for at least seven years to comply with tax and accounting regulations. You may request deletion of your personal information, subject to certain legal exceptions.</p>

Our incident response plan includes steps to contain the breach, assess the risks, notify affected parties, and take corrective action to prevent future occurrences.</p>

We encourage you to take steps to protect your personal information, such as choosing strong passwords, keeping your login credentials confidential, and logging out of shared computers.</p>
                        <p>If you have reason to believe your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please immediately notify us at security@veinsprout.com.
